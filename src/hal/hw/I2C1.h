/** IC_CON (offset: 0x0)
  I2C Control Register. This register can be written only when the DW_apb_i2c is disabled, which corresponds to the IC_ENABLE[0] register being set to 0. Writes at other times have no effect.


 Read/Write Access: - bit 10 is read only. - bit 11 is read only - bit 16 is read only - bit 17 is read only - bits 18 and 19 are read only.
  access : read-write
  reset value : 0x65
  reset mask : 0x0
  Field: STOP_DET_IF_MASTER_ACTIVE
  offset: 10, size: 1, access: read-only
  Master issues the STOP_DET interrupt irrespective of whether master is active or not
  Field: RX_FIFO_FULL_HLD_CTRL
  offset: 9, size: 1, access: read-write
  This bit controls whether DW_apb_i2c should hold the bus when the Rx FIFO is physically full to its RX_BUFFER_DEPTH, as described in the IC_RX_FULL_HLD_BUS_EN parameter.


 Reset value: 0x0.
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - DISABLED : Overflow when RX_FIFO is full
  Value: 1 - ENABLED : Hold bus when RX_FIFO is full
  Field: TX_EMPTY_CTRL
  offset: 8, size: 1, access: read-write
  This bit controls the generation of the TX_EMPTY interrupt, as described in the IC_RAW_INTR_STAT register.


 Reset value: 0x0.
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - DISABLED : Default behaviour of TX_EMPTY interrupt
  Value: 1 - ENABLED : Controlled generation of TX_EMPTY interrupt
  Field: STOP_DET_IFADDRESSED
  offset: 7, size: 1, access: read-write
  In slave mode: - 1&apos;b1: issues the STOP_DET interrupt only when it is addressed. - 1&apos;b0: issues the STOP_DET irrespective of whether it&apos;s addressed or not. Reset value: 0x0


 NOTE: During a general call address, this slave does not issue the STOP_DET interrupt if STOP_DET_IF_ADDRESSED = 1&apos;b1, even if the slave responds to the general call address by generating ACK. The STOP_DET interrupt is generated only when the transmitted address matches the slave address (SAR).
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - DISABLED : slave issues STOP_DET intr always
  Value: 1 - ENABLED : slave issues STOP_DET intr only if addressed
  Field: IC_SLAVE_DISABLE
  offset: 6, size: 1, access: read-write
  This bit controls whether I2C has its slave disabled, which means once the presetn signal is applied, then this bit is set and the slave is disabled.


 If this bit is set (slave is disabled), DW_apb_i2c functions only as a master and does not perform any action that requires a slave.


 NOTE: Software should ensure that if this bit is written with 0, then bit 0 should also be written with a 0.
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - SLAVE_ENABLED : Slave mode is enabled
  Value: 1 - SLAVE_DISABLED : Slave mode is disabled
  Field: IC_RESTART_EN
  offset: 5, size: 1, access: read-write
  Determines whether RESTART conditions may be sent when acting as a master. Some older slaves do not support handling RESTART conditions however, RESTART conditions are used in several DW_apb_i2c operations. When RESTART is disabled, the master is prohibited from performing the following functions: - Sending a START BYTE - Performing any high-speed mode operation - High-speed mode operation - Performing direction changes in combined format mode - Performing a read operation with a 10-bit address By replacing RESTART condition followed by a STOP and a subsequent START condition, split operations are broken down into multiple DW_apb_i2c transfers. If the above operations are performed, it will result in setting bit 6 (TX_ABRT) of the IC_RAW_INTR_STAT register.


 Reset value: ENABLED
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - DISABLED : Master restart disabled
  Value: 1 - ENABLED : Master restart enabled
  Field: IC_10BITADDR_MASTER
  offset: 4, size: 1, access: read-write
  Controls whether the DW_apb_i2c starts its transfers in 7- or 10-bit addressing mode when acting as a master. - 0: 7-bit addressing - 1: 10-bit addressing
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - ADDR_7BITS : Master 7Bit addressing mode
  Value: 1 - ADDR_10BITS : Master 10Bit addressing mode
  Field: IC_10BITADDR_SLAVE
  offset: 3, size: 1, access: read-write
  When acting as a slave, this bit controls whether the DW_apb_i2c responds to 7- or 10-bit addresses. - 0: 7-bit addressing. The DW_apb_i2c ignores transactions that involve 10-bit addressing for 7-bit addressing, only the lower 7 bits of the IC_SAR register are compared. - 1: 10-bit addressing. The DW_apb_i2c responds to only 10-bit addressing transfers that match the full 10 bits of the IC_SAR register.
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - ADDR_7BITS : Slave 7Bit addressing
  Value: 1 - ADDR_10BITS : Slave 10Bit addressing
  Field: SPEED
  offset: 1, size: 2, access: read-write
  These bits control at which speed the DW_apb_i2c operates its setting is relevant only if one is operating the DW_apb_i2c in master mode. Hardware protects against illegal values being programmed by software. These bits must be programmed appropriately for slave mode also, as it is used to capture correct value of spike filter as per the speed mode.


 This register should be programmed only with a value in the range of 1 to IC_MAX_SPEED_MODE otherwise, hardware updates this register with the value of IC_MAX_SPEED_MODE.


 1: standard mode (100 kbit/s)


 2: fast mode (&lt;=400 kbit/s) or fast mode plus (&lt;=1000Kbit/s)


 3: high speed mode (3.4 Mbit/s)


 Note: This field is not applicable when IC_ULTRA_FAST_MODE=1
  Enum:
  Value: 1 - STANDARD : Standard Speed mode of operation
  Value: 2 - FAST : Fast or Fast Plus mode of operation
  Value: 3 - HIGH : High Speed mode of operation
  Field: MASTER_MODE
  offset: 0, size: 1, access: read-write
  This bit controls whether the DW_apb_i2c master is enabled.


 NOTE: Software should ensure that if this bit is written with &apos;1&apos; then bit 6 should also be written with a &apos;1&apos;.
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - DISABLED : Master mode is disabled
  Value: 1 - ENABLED : Master mode is enabled

/** IC_TAR (offset: 0x4)
  I2C Target Address Register


 This register is 12 bits wide, and bits 31:12 are reserved. This register can be written to only when IC_ENABLE[0] is set to 0.


 Note: If the software or application is aware that the DW_apb_i2c is not using the TAR address for the pending commands in the Tx FIFO, then it is possible to update the TAR address even while the Tx FIFO has entries (IC_STATUS[2]= 0). - It is not necessary to perform any write to this register if DW_apb_i2c is enabled as an I2C slave only.
  access : read-write
  reset value : 0x55
  reset mask : 0x0
  Field: SPECIAL
  offset: 11, size: 1, access: read-write
  This bit indicates whether software performs a Device-ID or General Call or START BYTE command. - 0: ignore bit 10 GC_OR_START and use IC_TAR normally - 1: perform special I2C command as specified in Device_ID or GC_OR_START bit Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - DISABLED : Disables programming of GENERAL_CALL or START_BYTE transmission
  Value: 1 - ENABLED : Enables programming of GENERAL_CALL or START_BYTE transmission
  Field: GC_OR_START
  offset: 10, size: 1, access: read-write
  If bit 11 (SPECIAL) is set to 1 and bit 13(Device-ID) is set to 0, then this bit indicates whether a General Call or START byte command is to be performed by the DW_apb_i2c. - 0: General Call Address - after issuing a General Call, only writes may be performed. Attempting to issue a read command results in setting bit 6 (TX_ABRT) of the IC_RAW_INTR_STAT register. The DW_apb_i2c remains in General Call mode until the SPECIAL bit value (bit 11) is cleared. - 1: START BYTE Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - GENERAL_CALL : GENERAL_CALL byte transmission
  Value: 1 - START_BYTE : START byte transmission
  Field: IC_TAR
  offset: 0, size: 10, access: read-write
  This is the target address for any master transaction. When transmitting a General Call, these bits are ignored. To generate a START BYTE, the CPU needs to write only once into these bits.


 If the IC_TAR and IC_SAR are the same, loopback exists but the FIFOs are shared between master and slave, so full loopback is not feasible. Only one direction loopback mode is supported (simplex), not duplex. A master cannot transmit to itself it can transmit to only a slave.

  I2C Slave Address Register
  access : read-write
  reset value : 0x55
  reset mask : 0x0
  Field: IC_SAR

  The IC_SAR holds the slave address when the I2C is operating as a slave. For 7-bit addressing, only IC_SAR[6:0] is used.


 This register can be written only when the I2C interface is disabled, which corresponds to the IC_ENABLE[0] register being set to 0. Writes at other times have no effect.


 Note: The default values cannot be any of the reserved address locations: that is, 0x00 to 0x07, or 0x78 to 0x7f. The correct operation of the device is not guaranteed if you program the IC_SAR or IC_TAR to a reserved value.

  I2C Rx/Tx Data Buffer and Command Register this is the register the CPU writes to when filling the TX FIFO and the CPU reads from when retrieving bytes from RX FIFO.


 The size of the register changes as follows:


 Write: - 11 bits when IC_EMPTYFIFO_HOLD_MASTER_EN=1 - 9 bits when IC_EMPTYFIFO_HOLD_MASTER_EN=0 Read: - 12 bits when IC_FIRST_DATA_BYTE_STATUS = 1 - 8 bits when IC_FIRST_DATA_BYTE_STATUS = 0 Note: In order for the DW_apb_i2c to continue acknowledging reads, a read command should be written for every byte that is to be received otherwise the DW_apb_i2c will stop acknowledging.
  access : read-write
  reset value : 0x0
  reset mask : 0x0
  Field: FIRST_DATA_BYTE
  offset: 11, size: 1, access: read-only
  Indicates the first data byte received after the address phase for receive transfer in Master receiver or Slave receiver mode.


 Reset value : 0x0


 NOTE: In case of APB_DATA_WIDTH=8,


 1. The user has to perform two APB Reads to IC_DATA_CMD in order to get status on 11 bit.


 2. In order to read the 11 bit, the user has to perform the first data byte read [7:0] (offset 0x10) and then perform the second read [15:8] (offset 0x11) in order to know the status of 11 bit (whether the data received in previous read is a first data byte or not).


 3. The 11th bit is an optional read field, user can ignore 2nd byte read [15:8] (offset 0x11) if not interested in FIRST_DATA_BYTE status.
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : Sequential data byte received
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : Non sequential data byte received
  Field: RESTART
  offset: 10, size: 1, access: read-write
  This bit controls whether a RESTART is issued before the byte is sent or received.


 1 - If IC_RESTART_EN is 1, a RESTART is issued before the data is sent/received (according to the value of CMD), regardless of whether or not the transfer direction is changing from the previous command if IC_RESTART_EN is 0, a STOP followed by a START is issued instead.


 0 - If IC_RESTART_EN is 1, a RESTART is issued only if the transfer direction is changing from the previous command if IC_RESTART_EN is 0, a STOP followed by a START is issued instead.


 Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - DISABLE : Don&apos;t Issue RESTART before this command
  Value: 1 - ENABLE : Issue RESTART before this command
  Field: STOP
  offset: 9, size: 1, access: read-write
  This bit controls whether a STOP is issued after the byte is sent or received.


 - 1 - STOP is issued after this byte, regardless of whether or not the Tx FIFO is empty. If the Tx FIFO is not empty, the master immediately tries to start a new transfer by issuing a START and arbitrating for the bus. - 0 - STOP is not issued after this byte, regardless of whether or not the Tx FIFO is empty. If the Tx FIFO is not empty, the master continues the current transfer by sending/receiving data bytes according to the value of the CMD bit. If the Tx FIFO is empty, the master holds the SCL line low and stalls the bus until a new command is available in the Tx FIFO. Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - DISABLE : Don&apos;t Issue STOP after this command
  Value: 1 - ENABLE : Issue STOP after this command
  Field: CMD
  offset: 8, size: 1, access: read-write
  This bit controls whether a read or a write is performed. This bit does not control the direction when the DW_apb_i2con acts as a slave. It controls only the direction when it acts as a master.


 When a command is entered in the TX FIFO, this bit distinguishes the write and read commands. In slave-receiver mode, this bit is a &apos;don&apos;t care&apos; because writes to this register are not required. In slave-transmitter mode, a &apos;0&apos; indicates that the data in IC_DATA_CMD is to be transmitted.


 When programming this bit, you should remember the following: attempting to perform a read operation after a General Call command has been sent results in a TX_ABRT interrupt (bit 6 of the IC_RAW_INTR_STAT register), unless bit 11 (SPECIAL) in the IC_TAR register has been cleared. If a &apos;1&apos; is written to this bit after receiving a RD_REQ interrupt, then a TX_ABRT interrupt occurs.


 Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - WRITE : Master Write Command
  Value: 1 - READ : Master Read Command
  Field: DAT
  offset: 0, size: 8, access: read-write
  This register contains the data to be transmitted or received on the I2C bus. If you are writing to this register and want to perform a read, bits 7:0 (DAT) are ignored by the DW_apb_i2c. However, when you read this register, these bits return the value of data received on the DW_apb_i2c interface.

  access : read-write

  reset mask : 0x0
  Field: MASTER_ON_HOLD
  offset: 13, size: 14, access: read-only

  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : MASTER_ON_HOLD interrupt is inactive
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : MASTER_ON_HOLD interrupt is active
  Field: RESTART_DET
  offset: 12, size: 1, access: read-only
  Indicates whether a RESTART condition has occurred on the I2C interface when DW_apb_i2c is operating in Slave mode and the slave is being addressed. Enabled only when IC_SLV_RESTART_DET_EN=1.


 Note: However, in high-speed mode or during a START BYTE transfer, the RESTART comes before the address field as per the I2C protocol. In this case, the slave is not the addressed slave when the RESTART is issued, therefore DW_apb_i2c does not generate the RESTART_DET interrupt.


 Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : RESTART_DET interrupt is inactive
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : RESTART_DET interrupt is active
  Field: GEN_CALL
  offset: 11, size: 1, access: read-only
  Set only when a General Call address is received and it is acknowledged. It stays set until it is cleared either by disabling DW_apb_i2c or when the CPU reads bit 0 of the IC_CLR_GEN_CALL register. DW_apb_i2c stores the received data in the Rx buffer.

  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : GEN_CALL interrupt is inactive
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : GEN_CALL interrupt is active
  Field: START_DET
  offset: 10, size: 1, access: read-only
  Indicates whether a START or RESTART condition has occurred on the I2C interface regardless of whether DW_apb_i2c is operating in slave or master mode.


 Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : START_DET interrupt is inactive
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : START_DET interrupt is active
  Field: STOP_DET
  offset: 9, size: 1, access: read-only
  Indicates whether a STOP condition has occurred on the I2C interface regardless of whether DW_apb_i2c is operating in slave or master mode.


 In Slave Mode: - If IC_CON[7]=1&apos;b1 (STOP_DET_IFADDRESSED), the STOP_DET interrupt will be issued only if slave is addressed. Note: During a general call address, this slave does not issue a STOP_DET interrupt if STOP_DET_IF_ADDRESSED=1&apos;b1, even if the slave responds to the general call address by generating ACK. The STOP_DET interrupt is generated only when the transmitted address matches the slave address (SAR). - If IC_CON[7]=1&apos;b0 (STOP_DET_IFADDRESSED), the STOP_DET interrupt is issued irrespective of whether it is being addressed. In Master Mode: - If IC_CON[10]=1&apos;b1 (STOP_DET_IF_MASTER_ACTIVE),the STOP_DET interrupt will be issued only if Master is active. - If IC_CON[10]=1&apos;b0 (STOP_DET_IFADDRESSED),the STOP_DET interrupt will be issued irrespective of whether master is active or not.

  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : STOP_DET interrupt is inactive
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : STOP_DET interrupt is active
  Field: ACTIVITY
  offset: 8, size: 1, access: read-only
  This bit captures DW_apb_i2c activity and stays set until it is cleared. There are four ways to clear it: - Disabling the DW_apb_i2c - Reading the IC_CLR_ACTIVITY register - Reading the IC_CLR_INTR register - System reset Once this bit is set, it stays set unless one of the four methods is used to clear it. Even if the DW_apb_i2c module is idle, this bit remains set until cleared, indicating that there was activity on the bus.

  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : RAW_INTR_ACTIVITY interrupt is inactive
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : RAW_INTR_ACTIVITY interrupt is active
  Field: RX_DONE
  offset: 7, size: 1, access: read-only
  When the DW_apb_i2c is acting as a slave-transmitter, this bit is set to 1 if the master does not acknowledge a transmitted byte. This occurs on the last byte of the transmission, indicating that the transmission is done.


 Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : RX_DONE interrupt is inactive
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : RX_DONE interrupt is active
  Field: TX_ABRT
  offset: 6, size: 1, access: read-only
  This bit indicates if DW_apb_i2c, as an I2C transmitter, is unable to complete the intended actions on the contents of the transmit FIFO. This situation can occur both as an I2C master or an I2C slave, and is referred to as a &apos;transmit abort&apos;. When this bit is set to 1, the IC_TX_ABRT_SOURCE register indicates the reason why the transmit abort takes places.


 Note: The DW_apb_i2c flushes/resets/empties the TX_FIFO and RX_FIFO whenever there is a transmit abort caused by any of the events tracked by the IC_TX_ABRT_SOURCE register. The FIFOs remains in this flushed state until the register IC_CLR_TX_ABRT is read. Once this read is performed, the Tx FIFO is then ready to accept more data bytes from the APB interface.


 Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : TX_ABRT interrupt is inactive
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : TX_ABRT interrupt is active
  Field: RD_REQ
  offset: 5, size: 1, access: read-only
  This bit is set to 1 when DW_apb_i2c is acting as a slave and another I2C master is attempting to read data from DW_apb_i2c. The DW_apb_i2c holds the I2C bus in a wait state (SCL=0) until this interrupt is serviced, which means that the slave has been addressed by a remote master that is asking for data to be transferred. The processor must respond to this interrupt and then write the requested data to the IC_DATA_CMD register. This bit is set to 0 just after the processor reads the IC_CLR_RD_REQ register.


 Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : RD_REQ interrupt is inactive
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : RD_REQ interrupt is active
  Field: TX_EMPTY
  offset: 4, size: 1, access: read-only
  The behavior of the TX_EMPTY interrupt status differs based on the TX_EMPTY_CTRL selection in the IC_CON register. - When TX_EMPTY_CTRL = 0: This bit is set to 1 when the transmit buffer is at or below the threshold value set in the IC_TX_TL register. - When TX_EMPTY_CTRL = 1: This bit is set to 1 when the transmit buffer is at or below the threshold value set in the IC_TX_TL register and the transmission of the address/data from the internal shift register for the most recently popped command is completed. It is automatically cleared by hardware when the buffer level goes above the threshold. When IC_ENABLE[0] is set to 0, the TX FIFO is flushed and held in reset. There the TX FIFO looks like it has no data within it, so this bit is set to 1, provided there is activity in the master or slave state machines. When there is no longer any activity, then with ic_en=0, this bit is set to 0.


 Reset value: 0x0.
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : TX_EMPTY interrupt is inactive
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : TX_EMPTY interrupt is active
  Field: TX_OVER
  offset: 3, size: 1, access: read-only
  Set during transmit if the transmit buffer is filled to IC_TX_BUFFER_DEPTH and the processor attempts to issue another I2C command by writing to the IC_DATA_CMD register. When the module is disabled, this bit keeps its level until the master or slave state machines go into idle, and when ic_en goes to 0, this interrupt is cleared.


 Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : TX_OVER interrupt is inactive
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : TX_OVER interrupt is active
  Field: RX_FULL
  offset: 2, size: 1, access: read-only
  Set when the receive buffer reaches or goes above the RX_TL threshold in the IC_RX_TL register. It is automatically cleared by hardware when buffer level goes below the threshold. If the module is disabled (IC_ENABLE[0]=0), the RX FIFO is flushed and held in reset therefore the RX FIFO is not full. So this bit is cleared once the IC_ENABLE bit 0 is programmed with a 0, regardless of the activity that continues.


 Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : RX_FULL interrupt is inactive
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : RX_FULL interrupt is active
  Field: RX_OVER
  offset: 1, size: 1, access: read-only
  Set if the receive buffer is completely filled to IC_RX_BUFFER_DEPTH and an additional byte is received from an external I2C device. The DW_apb_i2c acknowledges this, but any data bytes received after the FIFO is full are lost. If the module is disabled (IC_ENABLE[0]=0), this bit keeps its level until the master or slave state machines go into idle, and when ic_en goes to 0, this interrupt is cleared.


 Note: If bit 9 of the IC_CON register (RX_FIFO_FULL_HLD_CTRL) is programmed to HIGH, then the RX_OVER interrupt never occurs, because the Rx FIFO never overflows.

However, it is important that care be taken to ensure that DW_apb_i2c is disabled properly. A recommended procedure is described in &apos;Disabling DW_apb_i2c&apos;.


 When DW_apb_i2c is disabled, the following occurs: - The TX FIFO and RX FIFO get flushed. - Status bits in the IC_INTR_STAT register are still active until DW_apb_i2c goes into IDLE state. If the module is transmitting, it stops as well as deletes the contents of the transmit buffer after the current transfer is complete. If the module is receiving, the DW_apb_i2c stops the current transfer at the end of the current byte and does not acknowledge the transfer.


 In systems with asynchronous pclk and ic_clk when IC_CLK_TYPE parameter set to asynchronous (1), there is a two ic_clk delay when enabling or disabling the DW_apb_i2c. For a detailed description on how to disable DW_apb_i2c, refer to &apos;Disabling DW_apb_i2c&apos;

/** IC_ACK_GENERAL_CALL (offset: 0x98)
  I2C ACK General Call Register


 The register controls whether DW_apb_i2c responds with a ACK or NACK when it receives an I2C General Call address.


 This register is applicable only when the DW_apb_i2c is in slave mode.
  access : read-write
  reset value : 0x1
  reset mask : 0x0
  Field: ACK_GEN_CALL
  offset: 0, size: 1, access: read-write
  ACK General Call. When set to 1, DW_apb_i2c responds with a ACK (by asserting ic_data_oe) when it receives a General Call. Otherwise, DW_apb_i2c responds with a NACK (by negating ic_data_oe).
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - DISABLED : Generate NACK for a General Call
  Value: 1 - ENABLED : Generate ACK for a General Call

/** IC_ENABLE_STATUS (offset: 0x9c)
  I2C Enable Status Register


 The register is used to report the DW_apb_i2c hardware status when the IC_ENABLE[0] register is set from 1 to 0 that is, when DW_apb_i2c is disabled.


 If IC_ENABLE[0] has been set to 1, bits 2:1 are forced to 0, and bit 0 is forced to 1.


 If IC_ENABLE[0] has been set to 0, bits 2:1 is only be valid as soon as bit 0 is read as &apos;0&apos;.


 Note: When IC_ENABLE[0] has been set to 0, a delay occurs for bit 0 to be read as 0 because disabling the DW_apb_i2c depends on I2C bus activities.
  access : read-write
  reset value : 0x0
  reset mask : 0x0
  Field: SLV_RX_DATA_LOST
  offset: 2, size: 1, access: read-only
  Slave Received Data Lost. This bit indicates if a Slave-Receiver operation has been aborted with at least one data byte received from an I2C transfer due to the setting bit 0 of IC_ENABLE from 1 to 0. When read as 1, DW_apb_i2c is deemed to have been actively engaged in an aborted I2C transfer (with matching address) and the data phase of the I2C transfer has been entered, even though a data byte has been responded with a NACK.


 Note: If the remote I2C master terminates the transfer with a STOP condition before the DW_apb_i2c has a chance to NACK a transfer, and IC_ENABLE[0] has been set to 0, then this bit is also set to 1.


 When read as 0, DW_apb_i2c is deemed to have been disabled without being actively involved in the data phase of a Slave-Receiver transfer.


 Note: The CPU can safely read this bit when IC_EN (bit 0) is read as 0.


 Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : Slave RX Data is not lost
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : Slave RX Data is lost
  Field: SLV_DISABLED_WHILE_BUSY
  offset: 1, size: 1, access: read-only
  Slave Disabled While Busy (Transmit, Receive). This bit indicates if a potential or active Slave operation has been aborted due to the setting bit 0 of the IC_ENABLE register from 1 to 0. This bit is set when the CPU writes a 0 to the IC_ENABLE register while:


 (a) DW_apb_i2c is receiving the address byte of the Slave-Transmitter operation from a remote master 


 OR,


 (b) address and data bytes of the Slave-Receiver operation from a remote master.


 When read as 1, DW_apb_i2c is deemed to have forced a NACK during any part of an I2C transfer, irrespective of whether the I2C address matches the slave address set in DW_apb_i2c (IC_SAR register) OR if the transfer is completed before IC_ENABLE is set to 0 but has not taken effect.


 Note: If the remote I2C master terminates the transfer with a STOP condition before the DW_apb_i2c has a chance to NACK a transfer, and IC_ENABLE[0] has been set to 0, then this bit will also be set to 1.


 When read as 0, DW_apb_i2c is deemed to have been disabled when there is master activity, or when the I2C bus is idle.


 Note: The CPU can safely read this bit when IC_EN (bit 0) is read as 0.


 Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - INACTIVE : Slave is disabled when it is idle
  Value: 1 - ACTIVE : Slave is disabled when it is active
  Field: IC_EN
  offset: 0, size: 1, access: read-only
  ic_en Status. This bit always reflects the value driven on the output port ic_en. - When read as 1, DW_apb_i2c is deemed to be in an enabled state. - When read as 0, DW_apb_i2c is deemed completely inactive. Note: The CPU can safely read this bit anytime. When this bit is read as 0, the CPU can safely read SLV_RX_DATA_LOST (bit 2) and SLV_DISABLED_WHILE_BUSY (bit 1).


 Reset value: 0x0
  Enum:
  Value: 0 - DISABLED : I2C disabled
  Value: 1 - ENABLED : I2C enabled
