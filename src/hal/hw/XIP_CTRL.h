  Cache control

  Field: POWER_DOWN
  offset: 3, size: 1, access: read-write
  When 1, the cache memories are powered down. They retain state,

 but can not be accessed. This reduces static power dissipation.

 Writing 1 to this bit forces CTRL_EN to 0, i.e. the cache cannot

 be enabled when powered down.

 Cache-as-SRAM accesses will produce a bus error response when

 the cache is powered down.
  Field: ERR_BADWRITE
  offset: 1, size: 1, access: read-write
  When 1, writes to any alias other than 0x0 (caching, allocating)

 will produce a bus fault. When 0, these writes are silently ignored.

 In either case, writes to the 0x0 alias will deallocate on tag match,

 as usual.
  Field: EN
  offset: 0, size: 1, access: read-write
  When 1, enable the cache. When the cache is disabled, all XIP accesses

 will go straight to the flash, without querying the cache. When enabled,

 cacheable XIP accesses will query the cache, and the flash will

 not be accessed if the tag matches and the valid bit is set.


 If the cache is enabled, cache-as-SRAM accesses have no effect on the

 cache data RAM, and will produce a bus error response.

  Write 1 to flush the cache. This clears the tag memory, but

 the data memory retains its contents. (This means cache-as-SRAM

 contents is not affected by flush or reset.)

 Reading will hold the bus (stall the processor) until the flush

 completes. Alternatively STAT can be polled until completion.

 The cache is flushed whenever the XIP block is reset, and also

 when requested via the FLUSH register.

 progress in the background, using flash idle cycles to transfer

 a linear data block from flash to the streaming FIFO.

 Decrements automatically (1 at a time) as the stream

 progresses, and halts on reaching 0.
